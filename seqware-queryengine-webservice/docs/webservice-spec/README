This project is a documentation spec for the RESTful web service being
developed for the SeqWare Query Engine (aka Generic Feature Store).  See
http://seqware.sf.net for more information about this project.

To build the HTML documents you can execute the following command:

  /usr/bin/ruby1.9.1 /usr/bin/nanoc compile

Keep in mind you will need nanoc setup correctly which can be tricky.  Make
sure you are careful with you PATH since I had multiple version of the
dependencies installed in a few different places and I had to override my PATH
to get this to work properly.
